							the town, whispering their names and causing disappearances if they look back at her. Each
							time she kidnaps any man, they leave behind all their clothes. To protect themselves,
							residents write "O Stree Kal Aana" (Oh Woman Come Tomorrow) with a magical liquid mix on
							their doorways. Additionally, men are advised to avoid going out alone after 10 PM during
							the festival and to move in groups for safety. This practice reflects a societal parallel to
							the precautions typically advised to women for their own protection.</p>

						<p> Vishnu Trivedi, a failing politician in the small town of Mathura, campaigns to ban live-in
							relationships, seeing them as a disgrace to the Indian conservative culture. At the same
							time, his party begins to lead an all-out campaign against film star Nazeem Khan, who is
							allegedly in a live-in relationship with his girlfriend, exactly the cause behind his grudge
							against live-in relationships.

							Vishnu's daughter Rashmi takes up an internship at a local news channel, and starts working
							with the channel's star reporter Vinod "Guddu" Shukla and his best friend, cameraman Abbas
							Sheikh. Guddu and Rashmi fall in love and Guddu proposes to her. Not ready for marriage, she
							suggests a live-in relationship, but he, being more traditional and somewhat scared of
							Vishnu, disagrees. As a compromise, Abbas suggests trying a live-in relationship during
							their 20-day business trip to Gwalior. The couple agrees.Once his family, too, catches up,
							Guddu reveals to Vishnu that the main reason for his loss in elections is his reluctance to
							change; since the majority of the voting group is the young generation, which believes in
							modernity, opposing the youth's methods would equal lack of support from them

						<p> Following the events of the first film, Stree leaves Chanderi after seeing her statue. Years
							later, a new threat emerges in the form of Sarkata, a headless ghost who abducts women at
							night. The townspeople believe the missing women have left for better opportunities. Rudra
							receives an anonymous letter containing missing pages from the Chanderi Puran with the
							message "Vo Aayega" (He will come). He warns Vicky, but Vicky dismisses his concerns.

							One night, Bittu’s girlfriend Chitti is taken by Sarkata. A beggar who witnessed the
							incident confirms the ghost's existence. The mysterious woman from the first film, known as
							"She," briefly appears to Vicky and informs him about Sarkata. Vicky, Bittu, and Rudra
							examine the torn pages of the Chanderi Puran and learn that Sarkata is the vengeful spirit
							of Chandrabhan, a former village head who was an alcoholic womaniser. He despised
							progressive women and murdered Stree when she was a courtesan, beheaded her husband, and
							burned them alive in front of their daughter. Stree later returned as a spirit, killed
							Chandrabhan and his associates, and buried their bodies. Now, after Stree's departure from
							Chanderi, Sarkata has returned to target progressive women.

							Realising they need Stree’s help, the group seeks out Jana in Delhi, who was once possessed
							by Stree.</p>
